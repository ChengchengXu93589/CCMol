First, run Step 1. This will generate the fragments from your required molecule. You can choose how to get different kinds of fragments.

Second, run Step 2. This will generate a part of the molecule from the scaffold in Step 1. This step will help you get the structure from ligand fragments.

Third, run Step 3. This step needs the FASTA sequence from your own data. Please determine the number of molecules generated by the FASTA sequence.

Fourth, run Step 4. This will generate the final result.

This model needs to run in an environment with RDKit, and the Meeko package is the key resource for generating molecular 3D structures.
